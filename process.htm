            <p>Through the course CCT260: Web Development and Design I, I've had the opporutnity to build my very own portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. 
                Since I already have an <a href="https://bernardljy2002.wixsite.com/portfolio/"><u>existing portfolio</u></a> that is currently hosted on Wix, I decided to 
                recreate it via this assignment. Rather than crafting a whole new design for this assignment, I thought that this would be the most efficient method 
                while retaining the online presence that I've already established thus far in my academic and professional career. 
                I do hope to continue developing this design beyond the class and have it replace the Wix-hosted site.
                In this page, I document my processes and reflect on my growth in web development and design.

            <h2>Design Inspiration: Simple but Playful</h2>
            <p>The design of the website is an attempt to playfully present an interface that is simple in design. A key aspect of web design is to create interfaces 
                that are clean and simple so that they're easily understood by users. Nielsen's 8th heuristic: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 
                is often quoted for this, emphasising that user interfaces should minimise distractions and keep the focus on the essentials 
                (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"><u>Nielsen, 1994</u></a>). 
                <br><br>
                While I always try to keep my designs simple, I wanted to showcase my portfolio in a more creative manner. I decided to make use of 
                bright colours like <span style="background-color: #EFF483;">light green</span> and <span style="background-color: #ED6B2D; color:white;">orange</span> 
                to capture attention, and combine a <strong>serif font</strong> with a<span style="font-family:IBM Plex Mono, serif"> mono font </span>to create contrast. The website also has 
                an overarching motif of rectangular shapes that can be found in the presentation of my projects and global navigation.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="content-section" id="developing-the-website">
            <h2>Developing the website</h2>
            <p>This was a simple website developed using vanilla HTML and CSS. Each page is built in a separate HTML page, which is then cross-linked via the navigation 
                bar present at the top of each page. Throughout the site, I attempted to keep my code consistent and easily understandable. To keep the HTML markups 
                organised, I made good use of<span style="font-family:IBM Plex Mono, serif"> classes </span>and<span style="font-family:IBM Plex Mono, serif"> ids </span>. 
                Every part that would have similar functions and characteristics are given the same class, and ids are further used to differentiate individual elements 
                in a class if necessary.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/About content section screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot of About page">
                <img src="Assets/Process/HTML use of class and id.jpg" alt="an example of the use of class and id in HTML">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>The "About" page consists of sections formatted similarly using the class "content-section" while each section is identified with a unique id.</figcaption>
            <p>
                In terms of CSS, I utilised in-line, internal and external CSS for various purposes. While the bulk of the design relies on the four external CSS 
                stylesheets (main, about, projects and process), I used in-line CSS for one-off styles that would not have to be replicated elsewhere in the site. This 
                way, I could keep the codes cleaner without having to create excess ids to be referenced in an external CSS. I used internal CSS for individual project 
                pages to differentiate between the background colour of the main project page and each individual project.
            </p>

            <figcaption>The main project page has a green background while the individual project pages have a purple background.</figcaption>
            <p>
                I also made good use of the flexbox function offered by CSS to easily align items that are presented in groups. For instance, my navigation bar on 
                the top of this document is made up of flex items.
            </p>

            <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
            <p>Information in my website is organised around simplicity and Dan Brown's Principles of Information Architecture in mind. All content are organised 
                with the assumption that the viewer will be a potential employer who would like to learn more about my background and experiences. As such, the 
                information architecture prioritises the "About" and "Projects" pages in the global navigation. I also incorporated many forms of contextual navigation 
                in the form of associative links and a footer to help the viewer find information about me quicker. These are summarised in the following tree diagram.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/IA Tree Diagram.jpg" alt="tree diagram">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>Tree diagram illustrating the information architecture of the current site.</figcaption>
            <p>I kept in mind the following principles (<a href="https://www.designprinciplesftw.com/collections/eight-principles-of-information-architecture"><u>Brown, 2016</u></a>):
                <br> 1. <strong>Principle of Choices.</strong> Offering meaningful choices help viewers find the information they need faster. In my "Projects" page, I 
                include a local navigation that helps a potential employer find the project relevant to the job.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/Example for principle of choices.jpg" alt="Local navigation in the Projects page">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>Local navigation helps the viewer find the information most relevant to them.</figcaption>
            <p>2. <strong>Principle of Disclosure. </strong> Showing a little information can help viewers understand what they can find when they dig deeper. In my home 
                page, I provided quick links to help a potential employer understand what kinds of projects they can expect to see in this portfolio.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/Example for principle of disclosure.jpg" alt="Preview of types of project">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>In the home page, I disclose what kinds of projects I showcase in the portfolio.</figcaption>
            <p>3. <strong>Principle of Exemplars.</strong> Showing examples help viewers understand the kinds of content on a site. In the "Project Highlights" section, 
                I showcase two examples of projects, selected from the full list of projects in my "Project" page.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/Example for principle of exemplars.jpg" alt="Examples of project">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>I show two example projects in my home page.</figcaption>
        </section>
        <section class="content-section" id="accessibility">
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>As far as possible, I made the portfolio easily usable for individuals with visual impairment and users of screen readers.</p>
            <h3>Colour Contrast</h3>
            <p>
                I treaded carefully in this section as I knew that some of the colours chosen (bright green, orange) are adventurous and may prove to be difficult to read in certain circumstances. 
                To ensure colour contrast, I prioritised the use of <span style="color:white; background-color: #194027;">dark green</span> as foreground with the <span style="background-color:#EFF483">bright green</span> as background.
                While my initial design uses <span style="color:white; background-color: #ED6B2D;">orange</span> a lot more extensively, I toned it down in the current site to ensure colour contrast. In the current site, orange 
                is used as highlights for crucial information.</p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/Wix portfolio colour contrast.jpg" alt="Site with orange used on bright green">
                <img src="Assets/Process/Current portfolio colour contrast.jpg" alt="Site with dark green used on bright green">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>Left: My initial website uses orange as foreground.<br>Right: The current website switches most orange to dark green.</figcaption>
            <p>
                All foreground-background colour combinations are tested using the WebAIM Contrast Checker to ensure that there is sufficient contrast and enhance readability, 
                with the exception of the use of orange in large texts in certain project pages.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="Assets/Process/Example of using orange in large text.jpg" alt="Use of orange on white" style="border: 1px solid #194027;">
                <img src="Assets/Process/Orange on white colour contrast check.jpg" alt="Orange on white colour contrast check" style="border: 1px solid #194027;">
            </figure>
            <figcaption>I stuck with the use of the orange colour on white since it is consistent with the overall design and passes the check for use in large texts.</figcaption>
            <br>
            <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">As much as possible, I used semantic HTML in my code to aid the users of a screen reader to interpret the website. This includes the following:</p>
            <ul style="margin:0;">
                <li><code>section</code></li>
                <li><code>article</code></li>
                <li><code>main</code></li>
                <li><code>header</code></li>
                <li><code>footer</code></li>
                <li><code>figure</code></li>
                <li><code>figcaption</code></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>Alt Text</h3>
            <p>All images in this site are given alternative texts, which will display when the image is unavailable.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="content-section" id="reflection">
            <h2>Reflection and Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Overall, this has been an enjoyable course and project as it allowed me to recreate my portfolio from scratch. While I've briefly learnt HTML and CSS before, 
                I'm glad that I opted to take this course as it was a good opportunity for me to refresh my knowledge and put it to good practice by building a local 
                website from scratch. I especially appreciated being able to slowly build up the site via the weekly lab activities, as it broke down the complicated process 
                of building a website from scratch into small, actionable steps that were not intimidating to execute.
                <br><br>
                Besides, I really appreciated that accessibility plays an important part in the course. When I learnt web development in the past, accessible coding 
                was almost never included in the syallbi. I've been able to learn about how to make my source code and designs more accessible for anyone who may 
                require alternative methods of accessing the website. In this website, I've tried my best to make my codes accessible for users with visual impairment, 
                but I acknowledge that there is still much room for improvement, especially with the way that certain sections like buttons and navigation bars are structured.
                <br><br>
                Moving forward, I do hope to continue refining and expanding this website by introducing responsiveness to different viewport sizes as well as publishing it 
                onto the Internet for easier access. I'd also like to improve the website's accessibility.
            </p>
